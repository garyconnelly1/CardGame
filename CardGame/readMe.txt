This is the readMe file for the graphics programming project in year 3.
For this project I have made a simple casino themed card game.
The rules are simple. Just click on an two cards until you get a match.
Once you get a match those two cards will remain face up. Once you clear the board, you have the option of playing again.
You can play as many games as you want, however if you do not clear the board within 3 minutes the game will automatically
restart on you, no matter how close you were to clearing the board. There is a timer on the screen to let you know how much
time you have left. 
You can cash out at any time by clicking the link at the bottom of the screen. This will bting you to another page with a canvas
identical to the card table. On this canvas is where I tried to hit most of the specs for the project. I created multiple moving
objects that look like casino chips. They are designed to fly around the canvas when the user is "cashing out".
There is a small bug in the timer however, as the timer runs out by itself and auto generates a new game, the timer goes into minus 
figures. I tried to rectify this myself but was unable to. 

There is also the added feature of marking the cards that have been already flipped to make the game a little bit more 
managable.

I immensly enjoyed making this project and learned a lot about how games are created from start to finish, as I was researching
ideas. I was trying to think out of the box by creating a card game, as I believe that many students will not think of having the 
actual game played outside the canvas, and the visual created as a result of that game inside the canvas. This project
is also very scallable and I even intend on scalling it as my skills evolve. For example, I could create a system that keeps
track of the quickest time somone has cleared the board. Or there could be level, where the next level would include 
the suits of the cards also rather than just the number.

I even find myself getting a little bit addicted to this game and feel that it is also good exercise for the brain.
I hope you gave as much fun playing, as I did building it.

Criteria:
User interaction: By clicking the cards.
Basic collision detection: The chips repell off eachother.
Cartesian to polar coordinates: In making the "pizza slice" design on the chips.
Illustration of - 
	movement: The chips flying around the table.
	rotation of objects: The different chips rotating.
Multiple moving objects: Multiple casino chips.
Sprites: The playing cards.
